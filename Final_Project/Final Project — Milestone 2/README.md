# Final Project Milestone 2: Hypothesis Testing Adventure

## Diving Deeper into Toronto's Robbery Data

After a thorough exploration in Milestone 1, I've now embarked on a quest to answer burning questions about Toronto's robbery incidents using the power of inferential statistics and hypothesis testing.

## Curiosity Leads to Clarity

With the stage set by the initial EDA, I've formulated intriguing questions that probe deeper into the patterns of crime across Toronto. My analytical arsenal is equipped with both one-sample and two-sample tests, ready to dissect the data and uncover hidden truths.

## Hypothesis Testing Odyssey

Each question is a journey, with null and alternative hypotheses as my guides. I meticulously document each step, from setting up the hypotheses to interpreting the p-values. The tests are a showdown between the expected and the observed, and I'm here to narrate the tale.

## Revelations and Insights

- **East vs. West**: The t-test reveals no significant difference in the number of crimes between the eastern and western neighborhoods. The city's safety balance remains undisturbed.
- **North vs. South**: Another t-test, another confirmation of equality. The crime rates in the northern and southern districts show no significant disparity.
- **Day vs. Night**: The paired t-test unveils that the cover of darkness does indeed harbor more crime, validating the common belief that nights in Toronto are less safe.

## The Story Continues

As I conclude Milestone 2, the data has spoken, but the narrative is far from over. The findings have painted a picture of a city where safety is not a matter of direction, but time does play a crucial role. What other secrets does the data hold? The journey into Toronto's crime data is ongoing, and the next chapter promises even more discoveries.
