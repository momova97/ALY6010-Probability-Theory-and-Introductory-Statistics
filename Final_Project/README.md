# Final Project Summary: In-Depth Analysis of Toronto's Robbery Data

## Overview of the Analytical Journey

This final report represents the culmination of an extensive analysis of robbery incidents in Toronto. Through rigorous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, we have prepared a refined dataset that captures the essence of the city's crime dynamics.

## Synthesis of Findings

The dataset, initially comprising 27 variables, has been meticulously curated to focus on the most relevant factors influencing robbery rates. We have distilled the data to nine key variables that provide a comprehensive view of the crime landscape, including the timing, location, and nature of the incidents.

## Investigative Questions and Regression Analysis

The analysis was driven by two pivotal questions that sought to uncover the underlying patterns of crime in Toronto:
1. What is the impact of daylight on crime rates across different neighborhoods?
2. Can the frequency of muggings predict the overall crime rate within each hour of the day?

Employing regression models and statistical tests, we have explored these questions to reveal the intricate relationship between these variables and crime rates.

## Key Insights from the Analysis

- **Daylight's Role**: The analysis confirms that daylight is a significant predictor of crime rates, with the occurrence of muggings serving as a key indicator.
- **Predictive Power of Muggings**: While muggings alone provide a strong basis for predicting total crime rates, the model's accuracy is enhanced when combined with the presence of daylight.

## Visual Interpretations

The accompanying graphs (Graphs 3 and 4 in the appendix) offer a visual representation of the findings, illustrating the variations in crime rates between day and night and the correlation between muggings and overall crime rates.

## Concluding Remarks

The final analysis provides valuable insights into the patterns of crime in Toronto. The findings suggest that while certain factors like daylight significantly influence crime rates, the city's neighborhoods do not exhibit a clear directional bias in terms of safety. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of urban crime and can inform strategies for enhancing public safety.
