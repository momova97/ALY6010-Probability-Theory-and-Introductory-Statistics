# ALY6010-Probability-Theory-and-Introductory-Statistics

Welcome to the ALY6010 Probability Theory and Introductory Statistics course repository. This repository documents my journey through a comprehensive course that has been instrumental in advancing my skills as a data analyst, combining a solid foundation in statistical theory with practical knowledge of data structures.

## Course Overview

The course was structured around two fundamental pillars that are essential for any data analyst:

### Statistical Theory
The theoretical component of the course equipped me with a deep understanding of the principles underlying statistical modeling and analysis. It was both challenging and rewarding to explore the theoretical aspects that form the backbone of data analysis.

### Data Structure
A firm grasp of data structures enabled me to comprehend the practical applications of statistical equations and how they can be applied to real-world datasets.

## Course Achievements

Upon completing this course, I have achieved the ability to conduct and interpret statistical analyses on a variety of datasets. This includes:

- Calculating the rarity of events through probability.
- Understanding the distribution of estimators to make informed, data-driven decisions.

## Course Progression

- **Modules 1-2**: These initial modules focused on the foundations of probability and distributions theory.
- **Modules 3-4**: I applied the theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios involving hypothesis testing.
- **Modules 5-6**: The final modules explored inferential statistics and their application in building statistical models.

## Key Learning Outcomes

As a result of this course, I am now proficient in the following areas:

- **Differentiating Between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics**: I can determine when to use each type of statistics and understand their purposes.
- **Calculating Expected Value and Variance**: These fundamental concepts are now part of my toolkit for data analysis.
- **Using R for Probability Distributions**: My proficiency in R has grown to include calculating probabilities and creating visualizations of distributions.
- **Organizing Data in R**: I can now create descriptive statistics tables by sub-group within R, showcasing organized and insightful data presentations.
