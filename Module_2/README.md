# Module 2 Assignment: Descriptive Statistics and Visualization

## Overview

In this assignment, I leveraged the skills acquired in Module 2 to produce descriptive statistics and various plots using class survey data. The aim was to create a comprehensive report with meaningful interpretations of the data.

## Instructions

- **R Script**: The R code for this assignment is organized under the subheading "Week 2" in the "R Script.R" document.
- **Statistical Outputs**: The results of the analysis are presented under the same subheading in the "R Outputs.docx" file.

## Process

1. Generated descriptive statistics tables for the entire sample and by group, using `psych::describe()` or other suitable commands.
2. Created visualizations such as scatter charts, jitter charts, and boxplot charts using `img()`, `par()`, and `abline()` commands.
3. Exported the charts and tables to the Word document and provided interpretive sentences for each output.

## Dataset Context

- **Source**: woodbine_horses.csv dataset from Kaggle (Visser, 2015).
- **Variables**: Contains data on races at Woodbine Racetrack, Toronto, from June 2015 to April 2017.
- **Woodbine Racetrack**: A Thoroughbred horse racing track known for hosting the Queen's Plate, Canada's most famous race.

## Reflection

This assignment was an exercise in extracting and presenting the essence of the dataset through descriptive statistics and visual storytelling. The process of creating various plots and interpreting the data has further honed my analytical skills. The resulting report and visualizations are designed to be intuitive and informative, making the insights accessible to a broad audience.
