# Module 1 Assignment: Data Import, Cleaning, and Basic Analysis

## Overview

In this assignment, I applied the skills learned in Module 1 to import, clean, and perform a preliminary analysis of a dataset. The goal was to create a data-rich and visually appealing report that provides insights into the dataset's attributes and trends.

## Instructions

- **R Script**: The R code for this assignment is organized under the subheading "Week 1" in the "R Script.R" document.
- **Statistical Outputs**: The results of the analysis are presented under the same subheading in the "R Outputs.docx" file.

## Process

1. Imported the dataset into R using the `read.csv()` function.
2. Prepared the `data.frame` for analysis by arranging variables, cleaning data, and applying appropriate data structures.
3. Generated and exported frequency tables, cross-tabulations, and histograms using functions like `table()`, `ftable()`, `CrossTable` from the `gmodels` package, `hist()`, and visualization libraries like `ggplot2` and `plotly`.
4. Created a report documenting the variables of interest, data cleaning steps, initial analysis, and results, including charts, tables, and graphs.

## Dataset Context

- **Source**: MLS.csv dataset from Kaggle (Wong, 2021).
- **Variables**: Includes neighborhood location in the Greater Toronto Area, composite housing types, single-family detached homes, single-family attached homes, townhouses, and apartments.
- **Benchmark Prices**: All prices are in Canadian Dollars.
- **Year-over-Year Changes**: Presented as percentages.

## Reflection

This assignment was an opportunity to bring together data analysis and visualization skills to understand and communicate the story behind the data. The resulting report and visualizations are designed to be intuitive and informative, making the insights accessible to a broad audience.

For more details on the code and outputs, please refer to the "R Script.R" and "R Outputs.docx" files in the repository. The complete R code is also included in the appendix of the report.
