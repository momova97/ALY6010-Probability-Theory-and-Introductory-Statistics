This assignment consists of importing, cleaning, and performing a rudimentary analysis of your dataset

 

Instructions

Provide the R codes in the R-script file under the sub-heading Module 1, and the statistical outputs under the sub-heading "Module 1" in the Word file (Step 1 of the instructions below). In general, your statistical outputs should be titled and labeled so that they can stand on their own (and can be understood by anyone who looks at them for the first time).

For R Script project:

For this project, create 2 documents. Mark this week's entry under a subheading "Week 1" within each document.
"R Script.R" - contains the R scripts associated with this work
"R Outputs.docx" - contains the outputs or the results
Import the file into R using read.csv( ) function
Prepare data.frame for analysis. Arrange variables (rename, drop, or keep variables), clean data (gsub or conditional assignments with ifelse() ), and apply appropriate data structure (i.e. integer, numerical, character, factors, etc.)
Prepare and export at least several frequency tables, cross-tabulations, and several histograms (preferably clean and with color, with appropriate titles and axis labels, etc.). You may want to look into table( ), ftable( ), gmodles::CrossTable, hist( ), ggplot2, and plotly, among others. Question: How do you show and compare the results across multiple classes?
Submit a report that examines parts 3 and 4 and your R script. The report should document

the variables of interest,
the data cleaning you performed,
the steps in your initial analysis
the results
charts, tables and graphs created
