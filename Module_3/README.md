# Module 3 Assignment: Hypothesis Testing with T-Tests

## Overview

In this assignment, I utilized t-tests to analyze a powerlifting dataset, focusing on understanding the differences in body weight and age by gender, and exploring the relationship between different lifting performances.

## Instructions

- **R Script**: The R code for this assignment is organized under the subheading "Week 3" in the "R Script.R" document.
- **Statistical Outputs**: The results of the analysis are presented under the same subheading in the "R Outputs.docx" file.

## Process

1. Imported and cleaned the dataset, making a subset of the first 10,000 rows to manage the extensive data.
2. Removed duplicates and outliers, and checked for normal distribution of the data.
3. Conducted one-sample t-tests to compare men's and women's body weight and age against the overall average.
4. Performed paired t-tests to examine the relationship between the Best Bench and Best Deadlift results.

## Reflection

The assignment revealed significant differences in the average age and body weight between genders and the population. Interestingly, while there was a significant difference in body weight and total for males, there was no significant difference in age, suggesting that professional powerlifters are predominantly in their mid-30s. The paired t-test indicated no significant relationship between the Best Bench and Best Deadlift results, allowing us to retain the null hypothesis. These findings provide valuable insights into the demographics and performance of powerlifters and highlight potential areas for further research and resource allocation.
